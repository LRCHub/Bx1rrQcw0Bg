I need you so, to keep me happy.
If I can't have you, I cannot go on.

I need your arms, around me tightly.
Oh, I'll need them nightly, when you're not around.

When day is gone... Oh, I need you so.
I long to hear... your little knock upon the door.

When you leave me, I try not to worry.
Please, come back in a hurry, because I need you... I need you so
