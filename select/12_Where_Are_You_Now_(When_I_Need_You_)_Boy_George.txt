I'm right where you found me
Someone left me on the street
Life moving around me
I said that I could not be beat
I said I was lonely
On my own I could not stand
You said ain't you only
Everybody's got it bad

Why talk about it
When you know you're gonna lie
Why talk about it
You can't even give me a reason why

Where are you now when I need you?
Where are you now when I need you?
Where are you now when I need you?

I said I was lonely
On my own I could not stand
You said ain't you only
Everybody's got it bad (Everybody's got it bad)
Life's moving around you
Everybody's on the street
Those beggars that found you
They're the ones that say defeat, they do

Why talk about it
When you know you're gonna lie
Why talk about it
You can't even give me a reason why

Where are you now when I need you?
Where are you now when I need you?
Where are you now when I need you?

Don't talk, don't ever talk about it
Don't talk, don't ever talk about it
Don't talk, don't ever talk about it

Where are you now when I need you?
