Everywhere you go
Everything you do
I need you
Everything you say
Every single day
I need you
Doesn't matter what we talk about
Doesn't matter what you say to me
'Cause I believe in you
You believe in me
I need you
Everything is real
Everything I feel
I feel you
Doesn't matter what you say to me
All that matters now
You're here with me
Doesn't matter what we talk about
All that matters now is you and me
'Cause I'm in love with you
You're in love with me
I need you
Why'd you go?
I don't know
You won't say
All this time
It's a crime
You won't stay
Everything you touch
Everything you feel
I feel too
Long before you came
Life was all the same
Without you
Doesn't matter what you say to me
All that matters now
You're here with me
Doesn't matter what we talk about
All that matters now - Is you and me
I'm in love with you
You're in love with me
I need you
Why'd you go?
I don't know
You won't say
It's not fair
Don't you care?
Won't you stay?
'Cause I believe in you
You believe in me
I need you - (repeat)
